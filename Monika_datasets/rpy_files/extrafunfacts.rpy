    m 1eua "This'll take a while to explain, so bear with me okay?"
    m 1eub "So first, i need to explain what the colors of the rainbow actually are."
    m 1eua "When you think of the colors of the rainbow, you think of the acronym ROYGBIV, right?"
    m 1eub "ROYGBIV stands for Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Indigo and Violet."
    m 1eua "When you hear the word 'violet', do you think of the color purple?"
    m 1eub "Well, that's not what violet is. You're thinking of an entirely different color!"
    m 1eua "You may have heard of the line used to start some simple poems: 'Roses are red, violets are blue', right?"
    m 1eub "This is what the rainbow's violet is. Violets are an actual flower in real life, and there are some whose petals are dark blue, or just blue."
    m 1eua "That would make it ROYGBIB."
    m 1eub "Now, the first 'Blue' in the acronym is actually cyan."
    m 1eua "If you're familiar with hex color codes, you may have noticed that combining blue and green creates cyan."
    m 1eub "Then that would make the acronym ROYGCIB."
    m 1eua "And lastly, Indigo isn't supposed to be in the rainbow at all."
    m 1eub "Indigo is a combination of blue and purple, which would make it by extension a combination of blue and red, with more blue than red."
    m 1eua "The reason why indigo is even in the rainbow in the first place is because the person who made the acronym included indigo to make it match the 7 notes:"
    m 1eub "Do, re, mi, fa, so, la, ti."
    m 1eua "So the colors of the rainbow are actually Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Cyan, Blue, or ROYGCB."
    m 1eub "And now for the other part, pink is supposed to be a blend of red and blue light, but you can't actually blend them since they're on opposite sides of the spectrum."
    m 1eua "Therefore, there are no pink photons, or pink light in general."
    m 1eub "The only reason why we can see these colors is because we're actually seeing red and blue photons, but they're so close together that our brain is blending them."
    m 1eua "And the same goes for the other colors like purple, magenta and indigo."
