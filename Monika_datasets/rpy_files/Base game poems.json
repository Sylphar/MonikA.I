It's the first one I ever showed you.\nAll about my epiphany, the first time I tried to reach you...\nHere it is, 'Hole in the wall'\n\nIt couldn't have been me.\nSee, the direction the spackle protrudes.\nA noisy neighbor? An angry boyfriend? I'll never know. I wasn't home.\nI peer inside for a clue.\nNo! I can't see. I reel, blind, like a film left out in the sun.\nBut it's too late. My retinas.\nAlready scorched with a permanent copy of the meaningless image.\nIt's just a little hole. It wasn't too bright.\nIt was too deep.\nStretching forever into everything.\nA hole of infinite choices.\nI realize now, that I wasn't looking in.\nI was looking out.\nAnd he, on the other side, was looking in."

I was getting a bit desperate conveying my emotions on this one...\nI'm so sorry Sayori.\n Still, this is 'The lady that knows everything'\n\nAn old tale tells of a lady who wanders Earth.\nThe Lady who Knows Everything.\nA beautiful lady who has found every answer,\nAll meaning,\nAll purpose,\nAnd all that was ever sought.\n\nAnd here I am,\n\na feather\n\nLost adrift the sky, victim of the currents of the wind.\n\nDay after day, I search.\nI search with little hope, knowing legends don't exist.\nBut when all else has failed me,\nWhen all others have turned away,\nThe legend is all that remains-the last dim star glimmering in the twilight sky.\n\nUntil one day, the wind ceases to blow.\nI fall.\nAnd I fall and fall, and fall even more.\nGentle as a feather.\nA dry quill, expressionless.\n\nBut a hand catches me, between the thumb and forefinger.\nThe hand of a beautiful lady.\nI look at her eyes and find no end to her gaze.\n\nThe Lady who KnowsEverything knows what I am thinking.\nBefore I can speak, she responds in a hollow voice.\n'I have found every answer, all of which amount to nothing.\nThere is no meaning.\nThere is no purpose.\nAnd we seek only the impossible.\nI am not your legend.\nYour legend does not exist.'\n\nAnd with a breath, she blows me back afloat, and I pick up a gust of wind."

Are they talking?\nOr are they simply poems on flat sheets of paper,\nThe sound of frantic scrawling playing tricks on my ears?\nThe room begins to crinkle.\nClosing in on me.\nThe air I breathe dissipate before it reaches my lungs.\nI panic. There must be a way out.\nIt's right there. He's right there.\n\nSwallowing my fears, I brandish my pen."
